# keyLogger
*FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES*

Created a simple program in python that tracks what keys are pressed on the keyboard.
Acts as a "keylogger" which would be able to find emails/usernames and passwords.

*UPDATE*

Made a C++ version for practice and to see the differences in difficulty between the two languages.
